ToDoList
===

ToDoList is a personal time and task management web application. Not only does it feature simple to-do-list functionality, it also provides task scheduling, planning, and time tracking capabilities. Because of the organizational power of its tag system, ToDoList is flexible enough to support users who need to do anything from tracking their grocery list to creating software feature release plans.

ToDoList was made to teach myself [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), Javascript, and their related ecosystems. Its initial purpose was to assist me in tracking the time I spent on work projects so that I could fill out my timesheet accurately at the end of the day.

The [live version](http://todolist.jgefroh.com) can be found on my website.
