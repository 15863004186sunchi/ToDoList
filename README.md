ToDoList
===

ToDoList is a basic web application I made while teaching myself [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), Javascript, and their related ecosystems.

It is a standard to-do-list with time tracking functionality. It was initially designed to group tasks together so I could fill out my timesheet accurately.

The [live version](http://todolist.jgefroh.com) can be found on my website.
